== Bitcoin and Lightning payments in Coinsnap Bitcoin Paywall ==

The Coinsnap Bitcoin Paywall allows you to accept Bitcoin for exclusive content and clearly differentiate your offer from the competition.

This is how you create added value – both for yourself and for the growing target group of Bitcoin customers!

With the Coinsnap Bitcoin Lightning payment processing plugin you can immediately accept Bitcoin Lightning payments on your site. You don’t need your own Lightning node or any other technical requirements if you'd like to provide payments via Coinsnap payment gateway.

Simply register on [Coinsnap](https://app.coinsnap.io/register), enter your own Lightning address and install the Coinsnap payment module in your Wordpress backend. Add your store ID and your API key which you’ll find in your Coinsnap account, and your customers can pay you with Bitcoin Lightning right away!

If you want to use another BTCPay server as Payment provider, you need to know your store ID, your API key and gateway URL as required parameters.
