The Coinsnap Bitcoin Paywall plugin allows you to implement Paywall and accept Bitcoin Lightning payments for restricted content.

== Description ==

[Coinsnap](https://coinsnap.io/en/) provides modules and plugins that enable operators of online stores and websites to receive Bitcoin payments from their customers' Bitcoin Lightning wallets to their own Bitcoin Lightning wallets.

= Features: =

* **All you need is your email and a Lightning Wallet with a Lightning address. [Here you can find an overview of suitable Lightning Wallets](https://coinsnap.io/en/lightning-wallet-with-lightning-address/)**

* **Accept Bitcoin and Lightning payments** in your online store **without running your own technical infrastructure.** You do not need your own server, nor do you need to run your own Lightning Node. You also do not need a shop-system, for you can sell right out of your forms using the Coinsnap for Content Form 7-plugin.

* **Quick and easy registration at Coinsnap**: Just enter your email address and your Lightning address – and you are ready to integrate the payment module and start selling for Bitcoin Lightning. You will find the necessary IDs and Keys in your Coinsnap account, too.

* **100% protected privacy**:
    * We do not collect personal data.
    * For the registration you only need an e-mail address, which we will also use to inform you when you have received a payment.
    * No other personal information is required as long as you request a withdrawal to a Lightning address or Bitcoin address.

* **Only 1 % fees!**:
    * No basic fee, no transaction fee, only 1% on the invoice amount with referrer code.
    * Without referrer code the fee is 1.25%.
    * Get a referrer code from our [partners](https://coinsnap.io/en/partner/) and customers and save 0.25% fee.

* **No KYC needed**:
    * Direct, P2P payments (instantly to your Lightning wallet)
    * No intermediaries and paperwork
    * Transaction information is only shared between you and your customer

* **Sophisticated merchant’s admin dashboard in Coinsnap:**:
    * See all your transactions at a glance
    * Follow-up on individual payments
    * See issues with payments
    * Export reports

* **A Bitcoin payment via Lightning offers significant advantages**:
    * Lightning **payments are executed immediately.**
    * Lightning **payments are credited directly to the recipient.**
    * Lightning **payments are inexpensive.**
    * Lightning **payments are guaranteed.** No chargeback risk for the merchant.
    * Lightning **payments can be used worldwide.**
    * Lightning **payments are perfect for micropayments.**
